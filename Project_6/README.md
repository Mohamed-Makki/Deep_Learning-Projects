Welcome to the **EMOTION RECOGNITION Project**! 🎉

This project leverages deep learning to classify human facial expressions into 7 categories: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**. With this model, you can identify emotions from facial images in real-time! 😁

## Features 🌟

- **Emotion Detection**: Detect emotions from facial images.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Upload an image to get instant predictions.
- **Grayscale Images**: Model trained on grayscale images for efficiency.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **TensorFlow**: Powerful deep learning framework for building and training models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, built on top of TensorFlow.
- **Streamlit**: User-friendly web framework to visualize the model and interact with it.
- **OpenCV & Pillow**: Image processing libraries for handling uploaded images.
- **Python**: The backbone of the project, providing the logic and structure.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Data Collection**: The model is trained on the **FER-2013** dataset, which contains images of facial expressions labeled with their corresponding emotions.
2. **Preprocessing**: The images are resized to 48x48 pixels and converted to grayscale to standardize the input.
3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: The model uses multiple convolutional layers to extract features from images, followed by max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
4. **Prediction**: The model outputs a probability for each emotion, and the highest probability determines the predicted emotion.
